# Scope 2 Change Requests

This backlog captures items explicitly out-of-scope for Scope 1.

## 1. Dedicated "The Institution" page expansion
- Why out-of-scope:
  Scope 1 is limited to copy/i18n/metadata and small UI tweaks only; no major route or structural redesign work.
- What is required:
  Content architecture for a full institution narrative, dedicated section design system, page-specific IA, and detailed UX copy flow.
- Rough effort:
  M

## 2. Full "Core Values" and "Business Sectors" visual sections
- Why out-of-scope:
  Requires new UI components/section patterns not currently present in Scope 1 constraints.
- What is required:
  New reusable components, responsive layouts, iconography/art direction, localized content models, and QA across EN/FR.
- Rough effort:
  M

## 3. Portuguese locale (`pt`)
- Why out-of-scope:
  Scope 1 allows EN/FR only and explicitly disallows adding Portuguese locale support.
- What is required:
  i18n routing/config updates, full `pt` message catalog, metadata translations, locale QA, and regression tests.
- Rough effort:
  M

## 4. Careers page
- Why out-of-scope:
  Adding recruitment pages is explicitly excluded from Scope 1.
- What is required:
  New route, UX/content strategy, forms/workflow integration (if needed), and SEO/analytics setup.
- Rough effort:
  M

## 5. Letterhead deliverable
- Why out-of-scope:
  This is an external brand collateral/document design deliverable, not a website scope item.
- What is required:
  Graphic design production (print/digital templates), brand QA, and stakeholder approval cycle.
- Rough effort:
