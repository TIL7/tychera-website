I will implement a **GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow** to bypass the Vercel permissions issue. This is the most robust, free solution for your scenario because it decouples the "git author" (`kiiromate`) from the "deployer" (which will be a Vercel Token owned by `tychera`).

Here is the execution plan:

1. **Analyze Current Configuration**:

   * Check for existing `.vercel` configuration or `vercel.json` to attempt to retrieve Project/Org IDs (read-only).

   * Check for any existing GitHub workflows.

2. **Implement GitHub Actions Workflow**:

   * Create `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml`.

   * Configure it to trigger on pushes to `main`.

   * Set it up to build and deploy using the Vercel CLI, authenticated via a `VERCEL_TOKEN` secret.

3. **Create Comprehensive Documentation (`DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md`)**:

   * **Step-by-Step Guide**: How to generate the `VERCEL_TOKEN` from the `tychera` Vercel account.

   * **Configuration**: How to add `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, and `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` to the `TIL7` GitHub repository secrets.

   * **Verification**: A checklist to confirm the pipeline works.

   * **Long-term Strategy**: Explanation of why this architecture is superior for cross-account collaboration on the freemium tier.

4. **Consolidate & Verify**:

   * Ensure the language switching code is on `main` (from previous steps).

   * Commit the new workflow and documentation
